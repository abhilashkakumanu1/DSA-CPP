Dynamic arrays are called as **vectors** in C++. Everytime, you add a new element beyond their size, they just doule in size. We can look at this using `size()` and `capacity()` methods on the vector.

Hash tables (maps, dictionaries, associative array, lookup table) are really cool Data Structures. It (ideally) takes `O(1)` to lookup for a key. There are different flavours of hash tables in C++ STL. unordered_maps (for key-value pairs) and unordered_sets (just contain keys - when we only care about existence of an element)
